# Software Engineering Documentation Samples  
This repository contains selected documentation and diagrams from my coursework at Arizona State University.  

These samples demonstrate my ability to:  
- Create structured technical documentation (reports, requirements, and analysis).  
- Develop and explain UML diagrams and system models.  
- Communicate technical information clearly for both technical and non-technical audiences.
